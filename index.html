				<h1>Our Business</h1>
				<p>
					The President of JC Communications, Joe Calderone, offers experienced crisis management, public affairs and media consulting with a reputation for honesty that is widely respected by the New York Tri-State press corps. As Vice President of Public Affairs & Customer Service for the Long Island Rail Road, Calderone interacts daily with reporters for print, radio, TV and online media. In addition, his 25 years experience as a reporter and editor, including at the NY Daily News and New York Newsday, gives him key insight into how the media actually operates. Many other public relations firms employ representatives who have never worked in the media.

					Calderoneâ€™s experience allows him to work through critical situations with clients quickly, spotting key issues the media and public will focus upon and developing strategies to address these concerns to achieve the best possible outcome.  His reputation in the media and expertise also helps clients get their story told, using the latest techniques and technology.

					At the LIRR, Calderone designed and implemented a social media strategy using Twitter, Facebook, YouTube & Instagram. This effort was aimed at monitoring and responding to customer feedback in real time for a high profile operation that serves the public around the clock, transporting 81 million customers a year. The effort was successfully tested during Supterstorm Sandy, winning accolades from The New York Times. Calderone also spearheaded the introduction of the first LIRR app for IPhone and Android smart phones. 

					JC Productions will put its experience to work for clients, offering results driven media strategies to bolster and protect your bottom line and reputation, even under the most challenging of situations.
